- [ ] Any tree possible could be in the parents of a class (e.g. blocks for default params out of order)
- [ ] fix pattern exhaustivity analysis
- [ ] java.lang.Enum empty ctor parent
- [ ] deeply recursive bounds on higher kinded types
- [ ] Need better error for when top level module is missing from classpath. (currently we get an error creating a singleton type from NoSymbol)
- [ ] Annotations
- [ ] Ignore open modifier
- [ ] check that the error in seeing `scala.collection.immutable.List` in `F[_] <: List[_]` is to do with module names

Dotty only

- [ ] Union types
